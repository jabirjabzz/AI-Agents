# Mini AI Agents

This repository is a collection of mini AI agents, each designed for a specific task. We're exploring the possibilities of creating simple, yet powerful, AI agents and invite you to join us on this journey!

## What is this repository about?

This project aims to provide a library of small, self-contained AI agents that can be easily integrated into other projects. Think of them as building blocks for more complex AI applications. We are actively developing and experimenting with new agent designs and functionalities.

## Why contribute?

This is a community-driven project, and your contributions are highly valued! We believe that diverse perspectives and ideas will lead to more innovative and robust mini AI agents. Whether you're a seasoned AI expert or just starting your exploration of the field, there's a place for you here.

## Featured Agents

*(This section will grow as you add agents)*

*   **Example Agent (agent_name.py):**  A brief description of what this agent does.  Mention any key features or algorithms used.  (Replace with your actual agent names and descriptions)
*   **Another Agent (another_agent.py):**  Short description of this agent.
*   *(Add more agents as you develop them)*

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/AI-AGENTS.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your-username/AI-AGENTS.git)  # Replace with your repo URL
    ```

2.  **(Optional) Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv  # Create a virtual environment
    source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate the environment (Linux/macOS)
    .venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the environment (Windows)
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies (if any):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements file
    ```

4.  **Explore the agents:**  Navigate to the directory of the agent you're interested in and read the agent's specific README (if it has one) or the code itself.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds, including:

*   **New agent ideas:** Have a brilliant idea for a mini AI agent? Share it with us by opening an issue! We're always looking for new and exciting applications.
*   **Code contributions:** Help us implement new agents, improve existing ones, or fix bugs.  See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines.
